# Material Breeding Simulator 2020
Sam Kagan

### How to Play
Move around and place blocks according to the material you've selected.

#### The Materials
There are four materials that were going to be bred together:
* Wood: it's brown
* Gel: it's green
* Metal: it's brown with lots of splotches
* Stone: it's gray with lines

While they're no different except for their textures right now, they are treated
as if they are totally different.
